You asked me if an ordinary person by studying hard get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine?
Of-course I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There’s no miracle people,
it just happens that they got interested in these things, and they learned all the stuff.
They’re just people, there’s no talent, special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or miracle ability
to imagine electromagnetic field that comes without practice and reading and learning and studying.
So, if you say you take an ordinary person who willingly to devote great deal of time and
study and work and thinking and mathematics and timing then he becomes a scientist.
